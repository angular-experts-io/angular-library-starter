## How to use this starter

### Use the template

To use this starter you have to click on the `Use Template`. Once you have the template, clone it, and run the following commands.

```bash
npm ci
```

### Customization

Once you cloned the template you can run the fllowing command to customise it.

```bash
npm run customize
```

## Showcase deployment

This starter uses a Github action to automatically deploy your showcase to GitHub pages.
If this doesn't work out of the box you probably have to enable deployments under the settings of your repository.

To enable deployments go to the settings of your repository and navigate to the `Pages` section and choose the `gh-pages` branch as source.
Note that this branch will be created automatically once you push your code to the repository.

## Use fully automated releases

In order to make fully automated releases work you have to add two tokens as repository secrets.

- `GH_TOKEN`
- `NPM_TOKEN`
